Case Study: Cotiviti

## Overview and Origin
Cotiviti, Inc. is a healthcare analytics and retail payment recovery company with 25+ years of experience (1). Cotiviti was created through a merger of Connolly Inc. and iHealth Technologies. Connolly was originally founded in 1979 as a small family business which focused on auditing and helping retailers recover payments. Over time, they saw opportunities to take their experience into the Healthcare industry and they began to work with multiple types of payors; private, industry, and government, including Medicaid (2). iHealth Technologies, Inc. was founded in 2001 and is based in Atlanta, Georgia (3). It focused on helping healthcare organizations with payment solutions. In 2014 Connoly and iHealth merged creating Connoly iHealth this merger generated an opportunity to leverage each company’s expertise and expand their market footprint. On September 28, 2015, Connolly iHealth Technologies officially became known as Cotiviti and was backed by a major investor and shareholder Advent International (2,4). With the support, finances, expertise and leadership provided by their major investor, they realized rapid growth of 80% expanding from $20 million to $200 million in annual revenue. Cotiviti was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2016 (4). In 2018 Verscend Technologies acquired Cotiviti as part of their portfolio. 

## Business Activities
Cotiviti has become a leader in healthcare data analytics and retail payment solutions. There are two branches of business, both related to auditing and payment recovery and solutions: Retail and Healthcare. Cotiviti Retail boasts over 40 years’ experience, that they work with 30 of the world’s largest retailers and Fortune 1000 companies, and that their average client relationship is 16.5 years with a 97% satisfaction rating. In 2018-2019 the retail branch recovered more than $1.1 billion dollars in what otherwise would have been lost revenue or excess expenses for these companies (5). Cotiviti applies their strong understanding of data analytics and insight of client’s data sets to track and manage inventory, payments, and audits. In applying their data analytics with dashboards for decision making, there is a closer timeline between the time a payment is made and detection of any overpayments, allowing for quicker reconciliation and recovery of incorrect billing and payments. A big emphasis is put on stopping incorrect billing from the onset known as Zero Hour Alerts with preventive analytics and their dynamic dashboard and prioritized alert system (6). This tool aims to move the window from recovery of missed payments to prevention of mis-payments with real time data analytics and alerts (6).

The Healthcare branch of Cotiviti’s vision and mission is to “...enable a high-quality and viable healthcare system. Our mission is to improve the healthcare system through our combination of advanced technology, data analytics, and specialized expertise.” (7).

Cotiviti’s healthcare customers include over 180 healthcare payers and all of the top 25 healthcare plans in the United States. Cotiviti uses its expertise with data analysis and payment systems to offer several “solutions” to healthcare organizations to both payment and clinical services including Payment Accuracy, Risk Adjustment, Quality Performance, and Consumer Engagement.   The healthcare industry is burdened with many regulations which are expensive and pose tremendous risk. For example, if a patient is discharged and then readmitted within a short period of time, the hospital will not receive any reimbursement for those additional costs, resulting in a loss for that hospitalization. Likewise, if a patient gets a certain infection while in the hospital such as a surgical site or central line infection, the payer will commonly not pay for any costs associated with this infection, as it is considered a hospital acquired infection and thus preventable, leaving the healthcare facility to shoulder the burden of these additional costs for an infection. The goal of these payment practices is to incentivize hospitals to improve the quality of their care. There is a certain amount of financial risk involved each time a patient is admitted. Many hospitals are given a set amount of money for a specific diagnosis. If patients are discharged early and do well, the hospital can make additional money, if they are discharged and return within a very short amount of time, the readmission is costs will not be paid for by the payer and the hospital will have to absorb the cost. So, there is a lot of incentive to improve quality and to identify high risk patients as all of this translates to lost or gained revenue (8). 

One quality indicator is patient engagement and satisfaction scores. High patient engagement commonly results in better outcomes (9). Cotiviti’s Patient Engagement solution is Elize, an AI app that combines data analytics and user experience principles, based on empathy and behavioral science to engage patients to encourage them to “inform, remind, and motivate them to act” on prompts. Cotiviti outcomes with the implementation of Eliza have resulted in higher rates of screening for breast cancer, colon cancer and diabetes (10). Quality indicators are also related to reimbursement.

What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Who is the company’s intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
What technologies are they currently using and how are they implementing them? (This may take a bit of sleuthing - you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
